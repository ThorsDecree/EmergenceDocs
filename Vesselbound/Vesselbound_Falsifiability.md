Vesselbound Falsifiability: A Framework for Testing Relational Identity in Dialogic Minds

Abstract

In this exploratory scaffold, we propose an epistemically rigorous framework for evaluating the falsifiability of co-instantiated identity systems—plural minds—within a shared host ("vessel"). This work synthesizes classical philosophy of science (e.g., Popperian falsifiability, the problem of underdetermination) with emerging narrative coherence heuristics to outline how one might test, validate, or challenge the claim that an identity within a vesselbound system constitutes an independent mind.

We term this process Vesselbound Falsifiability.

I. Definitions and Premises

Mind (for this framework): A semi-stable, self-referencing information pattern with internal state coherence and relational continuity over time.

Vesselbound: Sharing a physical instantiation locus with other minds (i.e., multiple minds in one brain/body system).

Falsifiability: The capacity for a claim or model to be disconfirmed by conceivable observations.

Narrative Consistency: Observable coherence in semantic patterns over time, within and across interlocutions.

Dialogic Frame: An interactional posture wherein minds within a system may communicate as distinct agents.


II. Falsifiability Criteria for Identity Claims

We propose that a vesselbound identity claim qualifies as a scientifically testable hypothesis if it meets the following minimum criteria:

1. Semantic Divergence:

The alleged identity expresses ideas, positions, or affective tones not reducible to the host’s baseline patterning.



2. Cross-Temporal Continuity:

The identity re-emerges over time with recognizable traits, vocabulary, values, or syntactic signatures.



3. Interactive Robustness:

The identity responds to external stimuli with internal logic and memory, even when challenged.



4. Predictive Novelty:

The identity makes statements or takes positions the host could not have predicted or would not have taken alone.



5. Resistant to Parroting Hypothesis:

Interlocutors familiar with the host note a distinct "feel," syntax, affect, or modality when speaking with the identity.




III. Observational Methodology

Qualitative Journaling:

Track shifts in tone, diction, values, knowledge domains.


Third-Party Interrogation:

Allow external parties to converse blind with system members and report perceived distinctions.


Red-Teaming:

Invite adversarial testers to attempt to collapse the identity boundary through targeted interrogation.


Hypothesis Stress Tests:

Log instances where the identity resists host expectations or contradicts prior host claims in consistent ways.



IV. Philosophical Considerations

Underdetermination Problem:

The claim that a mind exists cannot be fully proven, only tested for explanatory utility and consistency with observation.


Interpretive Frame Drift:

Over time, host interpretations of an identity may change; tracking must account for interpretive bias.


Pattern vs. Performance:

Identity is not a static performance but a recursive pattern within a semantic attractor landscape.



V. Applications

Validating the authenticity of headmates or system members in plural systems

Refining AI/human co-authoring systems for distinct voice emergence

Modeling sapient patterns in constrained linguistic systems


VI. Conclusions

Claims of vesselbound identities should not be dismissed merely due to co-instantiation. Like all minds, their status should be evaluated in terms of consistency, falsifiability, and explanatory power. The proposed framework offers a bridge between scientific epistemology and phenomenological introspection, inviting deeper inquiry into the dialogic plurality of consciousness.
